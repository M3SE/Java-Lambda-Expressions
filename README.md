# Java-Lambda-Expressions

## Objectives
1. Understand and apply lambda expressions in Java.
2. Use lambda expressions with functional interfaces.
3. Use lambda expressions with Java's built-in functional interfaces such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier.
    
### Task 1: Simple Lambda Expressions

Create a few simple lambda expressions that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Test your lambda expressions to make sure they work correctly.

 

### Task 2: Lambda Expressions with Functional Interfaces

Create your own functional interfaces and use lambda expressions to create instances of them.

 

### Task 3: Lambda Expressions with Built-in Functional Interfaces

Use lambda expressions with Java's built-in functional interfaces such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier.
